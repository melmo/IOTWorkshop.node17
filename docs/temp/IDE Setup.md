# Installing PlatformIO
+ Open Atom Package Manager
  + Windows, Menu: File > Settings > Install
  + macOS, Menu: Atom > Preferences > Install
  + Linux, Menu: Edit > Preferences > Install
+ Search for official platformio-ide package
+ Install PlatformIO IDE.

+ If it prompts you to install dependencies, do it
  + Namely clang [from here](http://docs.platformio.org/en/latest/ide/atom.html#ii-clang-for-intelligent-code-completion)

+ Also, anti virus software messes with everything you do, kill it with fire



or use pip
pip install platformio
... although you might then first have to install pip

also.... windows sucks... environmental variables may just not register...
Try just restarting if stuff doesn't work....
